# Design System Quality Gates

Token compliance:
- No arbitrary values
- No inline styles
- Semantic tokens only

Layout integrity:
- Grid respected
- Section order preserved
- Single H1 only

Typography:
- Correct heading usage
- No random weights

Theme:
- Dark mode via root vars
- No per-component theme branching

Failure on any gate = violation.
